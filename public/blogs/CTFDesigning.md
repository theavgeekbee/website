# Cybersecurity, CTFs, and Design!
Recently, I accepted an officer position at my school's cybersecurity club, [cyber5](https://cyber5.club).
Today, I'll tell you more about my new position as CTF Designer and how I come up with exciting challenges for members.

## What is a CTF?
A CTF, or "Capture the Flag" is a cybersecurity exercise where you're given an application, and you have to find the
hidden "flag," which is usually just a long string of text, through cybersecurity concepts.

## Designing a CTF
My design process goes like this:
1. Identify the concepts I want to teach
2. Create a story around the CTF
3. Design the challenges
4. Come up with hints to guide the participants

When I design a CTF, I like to first identify what concepts I want to teach. For example, I might want to design a CTF
around SQL injection, so I'll create some sort of database and a web application that's vulnerable to it.

I also like to choose a concept that is normally not already well-patched,
so I wouldn't actually do a CTF on SQL injection since
most platforms already have automatic data sanitization.

Next, I'll create a story. For example, I might make some sort of instant-messaging app, or a social media platform, and
then create and design that website and set up the database.

Then, I'll hide the flag in the database. Maybe put it in an imaginary user's comments? Or maybe a hidden link?

Finally, I'll come up with hints. The hints should guide the participants in the right direction, but not give away
the whole process. For example, for this CTF, I would give hints like "The flag is in the database" and/or
"Try leaving a comment."

## Tips for CTF Designers
1. Don't make it too hard!
   - Remember, the goal is to teach them something, not to make the participants feel bad about themselves.
   - You still want to make it a bit of a challenge though, so they can learn something.
   - Try finding the best middle ground!
2. Make it fun!
   - The whole point of a CTF is that it's a fun exercise. Who wants to participate in a CTF that's boring?
   - I like to make my CTF look like a realistic application, so it's more similar to real white-hat hacking.
3. Find problems and fix them!
   - There's probably going to be that one guy who finds an unintended solution to the challenge.
   - Try to find unintended solutions, and patch them if you feel like it. You could also leave them in as little Easter eggs!
   - Also, make sure your CTF is secure. You don't want someone to hack your CTF and change the flag to something else!

## Tips for CTF Participants
1. Don't give up!
   - It's okay if you can't solve a challenge. The point is to learn something new.
   - If you're stuck, try looking up the concept you're struggling with.
2. Use your hints!
   - There's no shame in using hints. They're there to help you.
   - If you're really stuck, ask the designer for help. They might give you a nudge in the right direction.
3. Read everything carefully!
   - Sometimes, the flag is right in front of you, but you just didn't see it.
   - Make sure you read **everything** carefully, and don't miss any details. 
   - There could be minute details in the problem description or hints that you missed.

## Conclusion
At the end of the day, I'm just a high school student who's interested in cybersecurity. Feel free to take my advice
with a grain of salt, or use it to design/participate in your own CTFs. If you're a professional, I'd love to hear
your advice; please reach out to me using the contact links. I hope you learned something new today!
